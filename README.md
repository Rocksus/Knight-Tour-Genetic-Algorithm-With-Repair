# Getting Started
## Running The Program
To run the program, just access `index.html` using any browser.

## Integrating to Firebase
To add storing capabilities, I have implemented a firebase connection.
First, in `sketch.js`, change `enableDatabase` to `true`.
Then, create a new file called `constants.js`
# To-Do List
- Add ACO Algorithm approach
- Add pure heuristics approach
- Open to suggestions!
